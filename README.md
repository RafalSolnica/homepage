## Description

Welcome to my first website created as a homework during the front-end YouCOde course. At the moment it contains some information about me, stuff I'm interested in and also my journey to becoming front-end developer but in near future I'd like to upodate it with new content to be a reflection of my skills and knowledge about front-end.

## Demo

To create this website I used:

- HTML
- BEM convention
- CSS
- JavaScript
- simple graphic style
